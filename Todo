* Add functions for writing MP3/FLAC metadata
* Write tag collection for playlists
* Figure out if i can decrypt tracks in parallel, I.E. X amount of tasks decrypting Y amount of chunks at the same time and then putting it back together
* Try to add progress output for downloading
* Most likely rewrite most of the code once the core funtionality is complete
* In rewrite, implement easy-to-use retry system for failures, I.E. I allow getting trackInfo to be attempted 3 times
* Create base class that all main classes inherit, base class will contain a bool for whether to log info in a debug-like mode
* Once satisfied with the codebase export functonality to class library
* Write headless server and API for interacting with the library
