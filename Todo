* Add functions for writing MP3/FLAC metadata
* Probably refactor trackInfo to group all metadata tags into a tag array for easy iteration
* Fully test album downloading and check if all tags aquired
* Write tag collection for playlists
* Once complete and stable export functonality to class library
* Write headless server and API for interacting with the library
